In this project, I created a function that allows the user to read from a file only one line at the time. It is possible to use it in a loop to retrieve as many lines as the file contains and as needed.

You can also define the size of the buffer BUFFER_SIZE by using the command -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 (you can replace 42 with any number). </br><b>Be careful with the buffer size</b> because using a very large buffer (e.g., 50000000) can slow down your program.
